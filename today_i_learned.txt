-- Key Takeaways so far from starting SQL:

SQL Basics

* SQL - (structured query language) A language used for interacting w. relational database management systems (RBDMS)

* Database scheme - The overall table design (blueprint)

* Query - A set of instructions given to RBDMS that tell RBDMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.


I. Introduction into tables

* Primary Key- (Natural Key) Has a purpose in the real world i.e. social security number

* surrogate key- (A type of primary key) Has no mapping to anything in the real world.

* foreign key- An attribute that we can store in a database table. A foreign key stores the primary key of a row in another database table.
(essentially is another primary key in another table)

* composite key- A key that needs two attributes (two columns) one column may have duplicates, so only together can they be a primary key
